  As a user
  I want the Google Smart Display to respond to my words
  So that I can

  - Query the current station
  - Query Google search engine during station playback

The main properties that should display on the Smart Display Screen are 

  - Station name
  - Holding image of station
  - Play / Pause icon depending on state

Requirements for environment

  - Google Smart Display
  - Google Home (Mini or Smart Speaker)
  - All devices connected on same network

And I say "Ok Google" to the Google Home device
